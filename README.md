# XAI Exercise

This is a repository for the XAI (Explainable AI) exercise. 

## Description

The exercise consists of training a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, and then creating a web application to visualize and explain the model's predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- `cfel.py`: Python class containing the code to compute the counterfactuals of the model.
- `LSM.py`: Python script containing the code for the LocalSurrogateModels.
- `process.py`: sample to encode various types of data.
- `vizualization.py`: script that provide the shap values.
- `main.py`: script that contains a sample of using entire flow.
- `data.csv`: generated data for testing purposes.
